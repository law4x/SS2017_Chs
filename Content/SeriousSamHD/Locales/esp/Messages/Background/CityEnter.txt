Children of Amon-Ra

As if getting into the Temple of Ptah was not hard enough, now it seems that the sacred sign of Amon-Ra is no longer being held here! There are relatively fresh additional inscriptions on the altar, saying that the sign was seized by a religious faction who call themselves "Children of Amon-Ra". Supposedly, they have removed the sign "as a sacrifice to the ram-god". I hope this is some kind of a metaphor, as it would really make things complicated for us if the sign was destroyed.

This way or another, according to the ancient texts, the Children of Amon-Ra are supposed to reside in the area around The Great Obelisk, which is not far away. You should gain access to that part of Memphis and look for the missing artifact.
