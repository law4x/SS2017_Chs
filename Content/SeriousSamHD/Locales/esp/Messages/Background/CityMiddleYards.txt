Holy Spirits

Ok, we've now gained access to the area surrounding the Great Obelisk. This is the part of town where priests of Amon-Ra lived. According to writings we've encountered in the mean time, it seems that common people from the area we just passed lived in fear of a giant monster with head of a ram that roams the city in the night devouring any living being unfortunate enough to cross its path. This might have something to do with the "ram-god" that Children of Amon-Ra are referring to in their inscriptions.

You should proceed towards the Great Obelisk, but be on the lookout for this "ram-god".
