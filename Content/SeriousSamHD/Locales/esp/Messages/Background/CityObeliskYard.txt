The Grand Obelisk

We've crossed the clerical part of the town now and the Great Obelisk stands right in front of us. Meanwhile, I've gathered enough data to decipher what is going on with the "ram-god". Apparently, there is this giant ram-headed monster which used to terrorize the city. It was interpreted by the local folks as ancient Egyptian diety called "Khnum", and they've made it a shrine at the bottom of an ankh-shaped pit in the center of the Great Obelisk. Priests are regularly offering "gifts" there, in form of animal and human sacrifices.

There is still no trace of the sign of Amon-Ra that we are looking for, but it all points out that the sign might have also been thrown into the monster's pit. Not sure what exactly is in there, and I know that the sounds coming out from there are not very encouraging, but your best bet is to get into that pit and look for the sign there.
