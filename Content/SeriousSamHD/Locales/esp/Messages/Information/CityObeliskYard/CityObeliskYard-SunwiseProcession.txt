The Great Obelisk - Sunwise Procession

One cannot enter the Great Obelisk directly. Ancient rituals from the Book of the Dead proscribe that "a sacred procession must be carried in the sunwise direction around the temple before Amon-Ra will open the door to the worshipers". Anyway, looks like you have to go through the door on the left and make a full circle around the Grand Obelisk to find the key in the process.
